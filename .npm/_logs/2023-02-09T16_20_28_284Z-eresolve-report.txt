# npm resolution error report

While resolving: my-portfolio@0.1.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.0.0" from react-particles-js@3.6.0
node_modules/react-particles-js
  react-particles-js@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
